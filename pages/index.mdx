# About the project

Welcome to the documentation site for **[time-table](http://time-table.sicsr.ac.in)**

Our goal while building this API was to make it as open as possible to other developers so that they can create their own frontend, or their own implementation with the data we provide.

We also tried to solve some of the problems with the old time-table system, such as the lack of a proper API, and the lack of a proper way to get the filtered time-table for a particular class.

There were also some UI issues on mobile devices, which we tried to solve with the new time-table system.

Here are all the people who have contributed to this project:

-   [Paras Deshpande](https://github.com/paraswtf) (Project Lead/User Research/Backend Developer)
